The problem I'm facing is in the pagination part, while searching using the restaurant name, it retrieves all the records but while moving to the next page of the pagination link the total row count is set to 0, although retrieving the data values from backend.

In the else part of my controller res_search(search controller) the search is being carried out for using the location options, and its working fine.
